MERN Stack Intern – Technical Screening Assignment Role: Full Stack Developer Intern Project: Mini Event Platform 1. Assignment Overview As part of our recruitment process for the Full Stack Intern role, we require candidates to complete this practical assessment. The objective is to build and deploy a full-stack web application that allows users to create, view, and RSVP to events using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This task evaluates your proficiency, your ability to implement critical business logic (like handling capacity and concurrency), and your competence in deploying web applications to a live environment. 2. Functional Requirements A. User Authentication (Security & Access) ● Sign Up & Login: Implement secure user registration and login functionalities. ● Tokenization: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless session management. B. Event Management (CRUD Operations) Authenticated users must be able to: ● Create Events: Collect the following required data points (feel free to add to details): ○ Title ○ Description ○ Date & Time ○ Location ○ Capacity (Maximum number of attendees) ○ Image Upload (Users must be able to upload an image, which must then be displayed on the frontend). ● View Events: A main dashboard must display all upcoming events. ● Edit & Delete: Users should only be allowed to modify or delete events that they personally created. C. RSVP System (Critical Business Logic) Users must be able to join and leave events, subject to the following strict constraints: ● Capacity Enforcement: The system must strictly check and enforce the event's defined Capacity. ● Concurrency Handling: The backend logic must be robust enough to prevent "overbooking" when multiple users attempt to RSVP simultaneously for the last available spot (i.e., handling race conditions). ● No Duplicates: A user can only have one active RSVP per event. D. Responsive User Interface ● The frontend must be built using React.js and must be fully responsive. ● The layout should adapt seamlessly and gracefully across Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile screen sizes, ensuring a clean and usable experience. 3. Technical Requirements & Deployment (Mandatory) ● Technology: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js. ● Deployment: The application must be fully deployed and publicly accessible. ○ Backend: Deploy the Node/Express server (e.g., Render, Railway). ○ Frontend: Deploy the React client (e.g., Vercel, Netlify). ○ Database: Use a cloud-hosted MongoDB service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas). 4. Optional Enhancements (Bonus Points) Candidates are strongly encouraged to implement one or more enhancements to showcase innovation and technical depth: ● AI Integration: Implement a feature (e.g., using a simple API call) to auto-generate or enhance the event description. ● Search & Filtering: Add functionality to search by title or filter events by category or date. ● User Dashboard: Create a private page showing events the user is attending and events they have created. ● Polished UI/UX: Advanced form validation, state management, or a dark mode toggle. 5. Submission Checklist Please submit the following two essential items: 1. Deployed Application URL: ○ The public link to the running, functional application. 2. GitHub Repository Link: ○ Must contain the full source code (client and server folders). ○ README.md (Mandatory): This document must include: ■ Clear, concise instructions for running the application locally. ■ A Technical Explanation detailing the specific strategy and code used to solve the RSVP capacity and concurrency challenge (e.g., using transactions, atomic updates, or locking). ■ A list of all features implemented.
